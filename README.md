# tuflow README

This extension provides syntax highlighting, including validation of command keywords, for TUFLOW.

## Features

Current version provides basic syntax highlighting. Future versions will add code completion/IntelliSense, as well as other features.

Unlike other TUFLOW syntax highlighting in other editors, this extension provides validation of TUFLOW commands. Only valid commands followed by " ==" will be highlighted.

## Requirements

VS Code ^1.0.0

## Extension Settings

None

## Known Issues

Currently, optional additional command keywords (such as the "MAX" in "Read GIS Z Shape MAX") are not supported by the syntax highlighting.
